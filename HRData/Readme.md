Hello!

I recently embarked on an exciting journey into the world of data jobs, utilizing SQL, Google Sheets, Python, and Tableau to uncover valuable insights. Hereâ€™s a summary of the key questions I explored:

### Key Insights:

1. **Workforce Distribution**: 
   - Analyzed the number of employees in each job role using SQL.

2. **Gender Diversity**: 
   - Created a detailed gender distribution analysis with Google Sheets.

3. **Age Demographics**: 
   - Visualized age distribution using Python to understand generational diversity.

4. **Salary Insights**: 
   - Dissected salary data to identify the highest-paying jobs with SQL and Python.

5. **Top Earners**: 
   - Developed interactive visualizations in Tableau to showcase top earners by job category.

6. **Education vs. Salary**: 
   - Mapped qualifications against salary brackets using Google Sheets to reveal correlations.

7. **Staff Growth Trends**: 
   - Analyzed historical data with SQL to uncover trends in staff growth over time.

8. **Leave Balance Analysis**:
