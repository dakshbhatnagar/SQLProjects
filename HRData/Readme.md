Unveiling HR Data Insights: A Multifaceted Exploration with SQL, Google Sheets, Python, and Tableau

Hey Data Enthusiasts!

I've been on an exhilarating journey recently, delving into the intricate world of data jobs. Armed with SQL, Google Sheets, Python, and Tableau, I embarked on a comprehensive analysis to unravel key insights. Here's a glimpse into the fascinating questions I tackled and the answers uncovered:

1) **How many people are in each job?** - Leveraging SQL for a meticulous headcount analysis, breaking down the workforce by job roles.

2) **Gender Break-down of the Staff** - Google Sheets came to the rescue as I curated a detailed gender distribution analysis, shedding light on the diversity landscape.

3) **Age Spread of the Staff** - Python worked its magic to help visualize the age demographics, providing a clear picture of the team's generational diversity.

4) **Which Jobs Pay More?** - SQL and Python collaborated to dissect salary data, revealing the top-paying jobs in the data realm.

5) **Top Earners in Each Job**- With Tableau, I crafted interactive visualizations showcasing the top earners within each job category.

6) **Qualification vs. Salary**- Google Sheets played a pivotal role in mapping qualifications against salary brackets, unraveling the correlation between education and earnings.

7) **Staff Growth Trend Over Time** - SQL stepped in again to analyze historical data, uncovering trends in staff growth over different time periods.

8) **Leave Balance Analysis** - Python's analytical prowess was harnessed to conduct a comprehensive analysis of leave balances, providing insights into employee well-being.
