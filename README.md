# SQL Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of SQL projects that I am going to regularly update. 

Each project is organized in its respective folder, including the SQL queries and associated data.

## How to Clone this Repository

To get started with these SQL projects on your local machine, you can clone this repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dakshbhatnagar/SQLProjects.git

```

## Project Structure

The projects are organized into folders, each focusing on a specific SQL project. 

Inside each project folder, you will find the SQL queries, datasets, and any additional documentation related to the project.
